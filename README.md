# Mastermind Exercise (by Mark Otterson)

A Mastermind Game created in response to a Programming Exercise prompt.

The game is invoked via the `MastermindConsoleEngine.Run()` method.

I included a comprehensive set of comment summaries for each class/method for the sake of clarity and consistency. Hopefully some of the simpler ones aren't too superfluous.
